Active Learning
(a) Convert a supervised learning problem (multiclass classification â€“ having more
than 3 classes) into an Active Learning problem by randomly removing class labels
of data points (retain only 10% of labelled points). The removed labelled points
will work as a human oracle!!
(b) Use stream-based and pool-based scenarios to label additional 10%, 20%, 30%,
40% data points.
i. use uncertainty sampling (Least confident, Margin Sampling, & Entropy) to
label points. Compare the three measures of informativeness.
ii. Use QBC (Vote Entropy & KL divergence) with at least 5 committee members,
to label points. Compare the two measure of disagreement.
iii. What is the size (number of points) of the version space? Order points to label
in such a way that the version space gets reduced by maximum with each point
chosen to be labelled.
iv. Incorporate the additional labelled points (separately, the best from i & ii) into
your model and compare with corresponding models trained with randomly
chosen labelled points. Also, compare with stream-based scenario.
v. From 90% of unlabelled points, randomly pick 40% of the points and use
clustering (using K-means with K=number of class labels). In each cluster,
randomly label 20% of the points to label remaining points in the cluster. How
accurate is the cluster-based labelling? How much saving it results in if each
label costs you Rs. 100 and each labelling takes one hour.
